# Tool Name : Dead Stock Detector
# Domain : Supply Chain/Inventory
# Author : Sidney Andreano
# Description: This function computes the financial holding cost and severity of risk
# towards a dead stock scenario. This can be helpful to know what product is at risk of "running out" soon.
# Usage : See README.md for a sample call.

        Computes the financial holding cost and severity classification of slow-moving or dead inventory.
        Args:
            units_on_hand (float): Amount of individual units of product that is currently available.
            daily_demand (float): A numerical representation of daily demand of a certain product.
            holding_cost_per_day (float): The cost amount per day of holding a product in inventory.
            cost_per_unit (float): The cost amount of a product per individual unit.
        Returns:
            dict: {

        units_on_hand:
            This parameter is invalid if the value is negative.
        daily_demand:
            This parameter is invalid if the value is negative and the special case when demand
            is zero, meaning days_of_stock cannot be computed (days/0).
        holding_cost_per_day:
            This parameter is invalid if the value is negative and taking the assumption that
            the cost cannot be zero.
        cost_per_unit:
            This parameter is invalid if the value is negative and the product cannot be sold for free.
